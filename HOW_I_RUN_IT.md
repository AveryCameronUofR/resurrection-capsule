# How I run it?
That just depends if you want to test or help with coding.

## I just want to test
In order to make tests with the local server, you will need:

- A computer with Windows 7 (or above) (most likely; it may be Windows 10 only);
- Darkspore installed;
- Your `hosts` file modified according to the specifications in **Server redirect** area in the README file (will change in the future).

Download the latest version of DLS from the Releases tab here in Github, and just run it. While it is running, launch Darkspore, and keep DLS running while using it.

   - Install Visual Studio 2019 ([Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16));
- Darkspore installed;
- Your `hosts` file modified according to the specifications in **Server redirect** area in the README file (will change in the future).

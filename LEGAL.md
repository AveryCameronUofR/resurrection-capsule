__DISCLAIMER:__ I'm not a lawyer. The observations below were made after I've read the game EULA. If EA sends me a message saying _"We want you to stop working in fake server and remove it from Github"_, I'm gonna do it (unless a real lawyer proves to me that my suppositions were correct). Still, since Darkspore is literally (and totally) unplayable for now, with no expectation of a fix, and this app aims to make it work only for people with an original copy, it doesn't look like EA would have a reason to be bothered with it.


# Is Darkspore-Fakeserver legal?
I'm glad you asked. I will divide it in topics, separated by _kinds of people_. 

## I've bought the game after March 2016
First, I will talk about about the legal implications related to me: a person which bought Darkspore not long ago (November 2018), after the game servers have been shutdown. 

You see, Darkspore's EULA is composed by 14 sections, and this is Section 4:

> 4. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate immediately and automatically without any notice from EA if you fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this License. Promptly upon termination, you must cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies of the Software in your possession or control. Termination will not limit any of EA’s other rights or remedies at law or in equity. Sections 4 - 12 of this License shall survive termination or expiration of this License for any reason. 

Interesting. But what does qualify the license has _terminated_ or _expired_ exactly? Well, according to Section 1-A:
> The term of your License shall commence on the date that you install or otherwise use the Software, and shall end on the earlier of the date that you dispose of or transfer the Software; or EA's termination of this game’s online __services__ and/or this License.

That means that the license was terminated in March 2016, when the servers were shutdown, and with that, the _online __services__ were __terminated___.

Repeating section 4:
> Promptly upon termination, you must cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies of the Software in your possession or control. 

Since I acquired a copy of the game _after_ the license was terminated, I'm subjected to a _different license_, which became valid after the original one expired. Basically, I need to follow the same as everyone else, except for Sections 1, 2 and 3. Well, that's the Section 1-E:
> Reservation of Rights. You have obtained a license to the Software and your rights are subject to this License. Except as expressly licensed to you herein, EA reserves all right, title and interest in the Software (including all characters, storyline, images, photographs, animations, video, music, text), and all associated copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein. This License is limited to the intellectual property rights of EA and its licensors in the Software and does not include any rights to other patents or intellectual property. Except to the extent permitted under applicable law, you may not decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer the Software, or any component thereof, by any means whatsoever. You may not remove, alter, or obscure any product identification, copyright, or other intellectual property notices in the Software. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by EA.
> 
> It is also strictly prohibited to use any third-party software or any other device with an intent to modify the Software in any way, intercepting or scanning game traffic or communications, changing the way the game plays or or in a way that could impair the correct operation of the game. Such prohibited third party software or devices can include, but are not limited to, those in the nature of “addons”, “hacks”, “cheats”, “trainers”, “mods”, or the like by any name. This License may under no circumstances be used for the purpose of creating or supplying any opportunity for third parties to access the game, including through server emulators or similar devices.

So the part of the license that prohibits decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer of Darkspore does not applies to me. Even if the last last sentence of 1-E explicitly talks about server emulators, 1-E does not applies to me at all. That makes the creation of Darkspore-Fakeserver legal in my case, and in the case of anyone who has bought a copy of the game after March 2016.

## I've bought the game before March 2016
Well, in your case, the license has terminated in the moment that EA has shutdown the servers. The only way to be completely clean for the license is to destroy all your copies of the game. However, there is one problem with that:
> This License may under no circumstances be used for the purpose of creating or supplying any opportunity for third parties to access the game, including through server emulators or similar devices.

When you accepted the agreement back then, section 1-E was still valid. Still, once the license expired this is no longer valid; you only need to _complete_ the termination of the license by destroying your copies of the game. After that you can buy a new one, and then contribute to the fake server, or simply use it with your new copy of the game.

## TL;DR
If you bought the game after March 2016, you are clean. If you bought before that, you must destroy your copies of the game and then buy a new one.


# Was EA server shutdown illegal?
Depends of where you live, and here is why: this is Section 1-I:
> Discontinuation of Online Services And/Or Features. This game, and your rights thereto as set forth herein, can be discontinued with thirty (30) days’ notice at www.ea.com/2/service-updates. _EA is under no obligation to offer or continue to offer specific items, features, reqards or __services__ to you as part of the Software_. Any items, features, reqards or services will be offered by EA in its absolute discretion and functionality may vary from time to time. EA reserves the right at any time for any reason to change and/or eliminate any aspect or feature of the Software and/or game as it sees fit in its sole discretion. 

So the part of the license that said that EA had no obligation to maintain the online services is no longer valid. Still, Section 7 is the Limitation of Liability, and it states (first part):
> 7. Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BYAPPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EA, ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOST PROFITS, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OR __ANY OTHER FORM OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT__, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, __CONSEQUENTIAL__ OR PUNITIVE __DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO__ THIS LICENSE OR __THE SOFTWARE__, WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT EA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. 

The law may consider the fact that the software is no longer functional has a _consequential damage_ in favor of EA. However, the rest of Section 7 states:
>__SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR__ DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATIONS OR __CERTAIN INTENTIONAL__ OR NEGLIGENT __ACTS__, OR VIOLATION OF SPECIFIC STATUTES, OR THE LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall EA’s total liability to you for all damages (except as required by applicable law) exceed the amount actually paid by you for the Software. 

So, if you country laws will consider that an infrigement of the license or not, that only depends of your country laws. The license gives them no protection in that case.

## It's illegal in my country!
Well, quoting section 7 again:
> In no event shall EA’s total liability to you for all damages (except as required by applicable law) exceed the amount actually paid by you for the Software. 

In that case, you are legally allowed to request a refund of the game (then you can use the money to buy a new copy of the game, which will make using fake server legal).
